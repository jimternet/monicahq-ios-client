Scan the `.auto-claude/specs/` directory for specifications\n2. Check which specs have corresponding feature branches\n3. Create new tasks for specs that don't have branches\n\n### Assessment Against Criteria\n\n**1. Scope Analysis:**\n- Estimated files: 2-3 files (likely a script/tool + maybe a task list output)\n- Services: 1 (single repository automation task)\n- Cross-cutting: No (self-contained automation)\n- Notes: This is a repository automation task, not a feature addition\n\n**2. Integration Analysis:**\n- External services: Git (already installed, standard tooling)\n- New dependencies: None (using existing git/filesystem tools)\n- Research needed: No (standard git operations)\n\n**3. Infrastructure Analysis:**\n- Docker changes: No\n- Database changes: No\n- Config changes: No\n- Notes: Pure repository/git operations\n\n**4. Knowledge Analysis:**\n- Patterns exist: Yes (git branch operations are standard)\n- Research required: No\n- Unfamiliar tech: None\n- Notes: Standard filesystem and git operations\n\n**5. Risk Analysis:**\n- Level: Low\n- Concerns: Task creation format/location needs clarification\n- Notes: Main unknown is WHERE to create tasks (GitHub issues vs file-based)\n\n### Workflow Type\nThis is a **SIMPLE** workflow type - it's a one-time automation task to sync specs with branches.\n\n### Complexity Determination\nFollowing the decision flowchart:\n- 2+ external integrations? **NO**\n- Infrastructure changes? **NO**\n- 1 external integration needing research? **NO**\n- 3+ files across services? **NO** (likely 1-2 files, single service)\n\n**Result: SIMPLE**\n\nHowever, there's a slight consideration: the user said \"create new tasks\" - we need to clarify WHERE. But this is a discovery question, not complexity. The implementation itself is straightforward.\n\nLet me create the assessment:",

Main validation is ensuring the script correctly identifies specs without branches and doesn't create duplicates.\n\n**Main Consideration**: \nThe task description says \"create new tasks\" - during discovery, we'll need to clarify WHERE these tasks should be created (GitHub issues, a TODO.md file, task management system, etc.). This is a requirements question, not a complexity issue.\n\nThe assessment file has been written to the spec directory and is ready for the orchestrator to proceed with the simple workflow (3 phases instead of 8).",
