# Specification Quality Checklist: Monica v4 OpenAPI Specification Generator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- All 5 user stories are prioritized (P1-P3) with acceptance scenarios
- 14 functional requirements cover all aspects of OpenAPI spec generation
- 9 measurable success criteria defined
- API scope quantified: ~100+ endpoints, 40 controllers, 45 resources, 65 models
- Edge cases documented for conditional fields, nested resources, file uploads, polymorphic responses
